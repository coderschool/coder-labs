# Steam Game Shop

<br />
<br />

## Intro

<br />

### Overview

Game is one of the most popular industries nowadays. With the game being created every minute and relayed through TV, radio, and the internet, the updated news on a game is already old by the next morning. And, that‚Äôs why game publishers such as Steam created a website to help the user obtain the most updated information about games at the ease.

So, game lovers of Steam are reading news and info on games at the convenience of their work desktops or mobiles. The traffic of the news online services is rewardingly high. We could run ads and generate a good amount of money. üí∞

### UI design

We are making a Steam app store, kind of, ours will be better.
Our inspiration for this website is from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com). However, you could choose to either make an exact clone of it or freestyle as you like. (üöÄ it is more challenging to create an EXACT clone).

## Backend API

We often use API services from others to have dynamic and up-to-date data in our application.

The good mentors of CoderSchool created this API service to help us get the latest news of the game deployed.

Here is the link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14499722/UVeKqQWh">STEAM API DOCUMENT</a>.

Even though API seems like the rabbit from hats, later in the course, you will be able to create APIs just like this.

You are expected to be able to find your way through this API by reading its documentation.

## Example UI design

<br />

#### Our suggested design

![Simplified sketch](./../../assets/wv/m13/steam-sketch.png)

Here is the [Link to the mockup ](https://excalidraw.com/#json=WeOH-cuYiBxtn7K94qjVn,JlYhwgD5vAy1Wc1UcbgNug)

#### Notes

- The dotted arrow from the `Search` button means that, when clicking, the user will see the below display with all the search results.

- The arrows from each `game` mean that when clicked, the user will see a new screen to display all the news related to that clicked item.

### Make your own

This is just **an example**. You could choose any design that you one or create one yourself using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), an easy-to-use mockup tool, to sketch out the initial UI design. Go wild üî•.

## Requirements

<br />

### User Story

As a developer, you will get familiar with the term "User story" at the beginning of any project. It describes what the user will be able to do/see with the application. User story sections are different from project to project, however majority of them will format like this :

1. User can see a list of games from the API in any format (list, gallery, ... )
2. User can see the game initial info (image, title, and price ...) in each item
3. User can see a Search input box
4. User is able to Search for games by app name
5. User is able to see the search results
6. User can see list of all genres (category)
7. User is able to filter games that match the genre and tag buttons that clicked.
8. User sees the website with a clean UI design.
9. User can view the website in an IphoneX screensize

## Rocket bonus üöÄ

User can click any game item in the gallery to see the detail of only that selection's detail (name, tags, description, price, developer...), replacing the current gallery.

There are 2 ways to make this happen. Redirect to a new HTML page and replace the HTML element of the current page:

1. The first method involves creating a new `.html` and `.js` page that will be rendered when an `a tag` is clicked. The challenge of this approach is passing the `appId` from the original `script.js` & `index.html` to the new `.html` & `.js` file so that the later duo could make the API request with the correct `appId` for example: `_https://someApi/appId/{appId}_.`
   Find more information about the `window` object mentioned in the lecture videos and look into the `window.location` property [document](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_location.asp) to find the solution.

This is the conventional way to render an `item detail page` in web development.

2. The second one involves creating a new `HTML element` to replace the current display of the page. For example: `main`, `body`, `.gallery`. The challenges of this approach are:

- Knowing when and where to `clean` the existing display before `append` the new content
- For user experiences, able to go back to the previous display after going to the app detail display and still seeing proper styling.
  Essentially you will have to `select` the right `element`; `append` the correct `content`; maintain or add appropriate attributes such as `class` ,`id` or `event-listener`.

This is **NOT** the conventional way to render an `item detail page` in web development. However, this is still an acceptable solution for this assignment and a method to see how `React` would render a `component of a page`.

<br />

## Outcomes and grading

<br />

### What you'll practice

This project challenge is designed to test your understanding on :

- Asynchronous javascript by requesting data from API with Fetch.
- JS on dom by accessing, creating, and editing HTML element
- JS basic syntax and fundamentals
- Basic HTML & CSS with appropriate tags and attributes; selectors and properties

### How we grade your project

You will start the assignment with 100% and will be deducted upon missing any feature.
Our passing grade for this assignment is 80%.

- _Missing rocket_ üöÄ: -5%
- _Missing any of other user stories that are not rocket_: -5%
- _Clustered UI_: -5%

**Good luck have fun coding!**
