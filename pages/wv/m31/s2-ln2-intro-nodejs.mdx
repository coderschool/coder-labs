# Intro to NodeJs

<br />
<br />

## Introduction

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Chrome, outside of the browser.
It simple languages, to run this code `in script.js`

```js
//script.js
console.log("hello word");
```

We would either use the browser console or use node to run the program

```cmd
node script.js
```

From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language.

### Differences between Node.js and the browser

In the browser, most of the time what we are doing is interacting with the `DOM`, or other Web Platform APIs like `Cookies`. Those things do not exist in Node.js, of course. We also don't have the `document`, `window` and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

Another difference is that Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.

In practice, this means that for the time being you use `require()` in Node.js instead of `import`

<br />

## Getting Started

<br />

### How to check that you have node install

```bash
node -v
```

```console
v14.15.4
```

Your version might be different, no worries. But if you have no version , please make sure that you follow this guide to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### How to run NodeJs scripts from the command line?

The node command is the one we use to run our Node.js scripts:

```
node script.js
node <path.to/js.file>
```

### Node.js built-in module system

A Node.js file can import functionality exposed by other Node.js files.

Import the functionality **exposed** in the `library.js` file that resides in the current file folder.

```javascript
const library = require("./library");
```

In this file, functionality must be **exposed** before it can be imported by other files. This is what the `module.exports` API offered by the [`module` system](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) allows us to do. To expose is to export.

```javascript
// in car.js
const car = {
  brand: "Ford",
  model: "Fiesta",
};

module.exports = car;

//..in the other file

const car = require("./car");
```

The second way is to add the exported object as a property of `exports`. This way allows you to export multiple objects, functions or data:

```javascript
// in car.js
const car1 = {
  brand: "Ford",
  model: "Fiesta",
};

const car2 = {
  brand: "Kia",
  model: "Sorento",
};

exports.car1 = car1;
exports.car2 = car2;
```

or directly

```javascript
exports.car1 = {
  brand: "Ford",
  model: "Fiesta",
};

exports.car2 = {
  brand: "Kia",
  model: "Sorento",
};
```

In the other file

```javascript
const cars = require("./car");
console.log(cars);
// {
//   car1: { brand: 'Ford', model: 'Fiesta' },
//   car2: { brand: 'Kia', model: 'Sorento' }
// }
```

Or you can use destructuring

```javascript
const { car1 } = require("./library");

console.log(car1);
// { brand: 'Ford', model: 'Fiesta' }
```

<br />

## NodeJS File system (fs) module

One of the most common module in NodeJs is the File System ('fs').
It provides us with methods to communicate and control our local machine such as : Read, Write and edit file, navigating and create folder.

Most of Node.js methods are available in to forms : Async (default) and Sync. Developers could choose which one depend on different scenario.

- **Reading files with Node.js**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("test.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

readFile is _Asynchronous_ meaning that code below will be executed before `readFile` finish. Try console.log outside the method you would receive undefined.

Alternatively, you can use the synchronous version `fs.readFileSync()`:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync("test.txt", "utf8");
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

fs.xxSync are _Synchronous_ methods, meaning that the method must be finish before other codes could be run.
Try create a global variable `myGlobal` and assign to it the value of `fs.readFileSync`. Then console.log `myGlobal` at the end of script file.

### Common FS module methods

The fs module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.

- `fs.access()`: check if the file exists and Node.js can access it with its permissions
- `fs.appendFile()`: append data to a file. If the file does not exist, it's created
- `fs.close()`: close a file descriptor
- `fs.copyFile()`: copies a file
- `fs.mkdir()`: create a new folder
- `fs.readdir()`: read the contents of a directory
- `fs.readFile()`: read the content of a file. Related: `fs.read()`
- `fs.rename()`: rename a file or folder
- `fs.rmdir()`: remove a folder
- `fs.writeFile()`: write data to a file. Related: `fs.write()`

### File extension

Because NodeJs allow us to communicate with our file system, it is important to note the differences of many different types of a file.

A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file (e.g., .txt, .docx, .md). The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces. Other extension formats include dashes and/or underscores on early versions of GNU Linux and some versions of IBM AIX.

Most of the time we will be using these file extensions `.md`,`.js`,`.css`,`.html`,`.csv`, and `.json` for many uses in programing. Knowing how to process these file extensions is also an important skill for developers at any level.

<br />

## NodeJS Path module

The path module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
```

Every file in the system has a path. On Linux and macOS, a path might look like:

`/users/joe/file.txt`

while Windows computers are different, and have a structure such as:

`C:\users\joe\file.txt`

You need to pay attention when using paths in your applications, as this difference must be taken into account. The `path.join()` method joins all given path segments together using the platform-specific separator as a delimiter, then normalizes the resulting path. More [details](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_paths)

## The Node.js HTTP module

The following example creates a web server that listens for any kind of HTTP request on the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` — when a request is received, the script will respond with the string: "Hello World".

- Create a folder called `test-node`. Create a new file called `hello.js`:

```javascript
// Load HTTP module
const http = require("http");
// Create some constants help configurate connection
const hostname = "127.0.0.1";
const port = 5000;

// Create HTTP server with http method
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response HTTP header with HTTP status and Content type
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  // Send the response body "Hello World"
  res.end("Hello World\n");
});

// Prints a log once the server starts listening
server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

- Execute this command in the terminal

```
node hello.js
```

Making API from plain NodeJS is a tidious task since we have to configure many repetitive setting. For this reason, API developers are using frameworks such as Express to quickly create a standardized API project.

## NPM Node Package Manager

The World's Largest Software Registry (Library). They host, stored and distribute more than 800,000 code packages. Open-source solutions, library ,softwares sharing platform.
Many organizations also use `npm` to manage private development. Another poppular alternateive is `yarn`.

- Recommended to start a npm for your project. At `root` !

```bash
npm init
```

```console
accept all question , enter keys
```

When starting a npm for your project, a `package.json` file will be create.
This file is writen in `JSON` format. Here lies all your projects infos

```json
{
  "name": "project_name",
  "version": "project_version",
  "description": "project_description",
  "main": "root_file",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "test command run",
    "start": "start command run",
    "xxx": "xxx command run"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "library": "library_verison"
  },
  "author": "author",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Required fields:

- name
- version

Importants fields:

- scripts: In scripts object, we specify the command pipeline to run when code is executed
- dependencies : list out all 3rd parties software that needed to be install to run this project. Thing that this project _depended to_. One benefit of this is to **minimize** codebase file size when transfering to other places : github, gitlab, **cloud service**. `package.json` keeping a list of `dependencies` name and version so that running the code would only need to use `npm install` everything in the list.

**REMEMEBER**: to install dependecies right after clonning, pulling or receiving any code.

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```

**WARNING**: Sometimes, you may encounter instruction to `npm i -g ...`. The `-g` is a flag that help us to install the software `GLOBALLY`. Ask yourself do you need to install this to **your entire machine** or just simply in the directory for your project. Be vert **cautious** on what you installing on your machine.

Also npm have many options, the list of them could be find [here](npmjs.com).

### Nodemon : Automate restart on changes saved

nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

using npm to install nodemon

```bash
npm i nodemon
```

Add new command for `scripts` in `package.json` so that your machine using `nodemon` to execute your code

```json
{
  // ...
"scripts":{
  // ...
  "dev": "nodemon yourStartFile"
}
"dependencies":{
  "nodemon":"x.x.x"  }
}
```

### Note on .gitignore

Previously :
_`package.json` keeping a list of `dependencies` name and version so that running the code would only need to use `npm install` everything in the list_

Yes, but we are missing one important step.
To not use git history track for files, softwarem or changes we must specify so to `git`. The `.gitignore` file contain list of _paths_ to files and folders that you wish not to track history. Thus, _not included_ in your `push` to `github` or any `cloud`

- At `root`

```cmd
touch .gitignore
```

- In `.gitignore` add

```t
# node_modules
node_modules/

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional eslint cache
.eslintcache

# Optional REPL history
.node_repl_history
```

**Warning** : one common mistake is to `git init` then `npm init` then create `.gitignore`. This will not have effect on `node_modules/` ignore since the `npm init alread make a node module` and the `git init before it has track the changes`. You may need to remove the `git cache` to fix this issue.

**Recommended** : Workflow

```md
1. Create folder structure
2. Initialize NPM
3. Install NPM to create `node_modules/`
4. Create `.gitignore` and add `node_modules/` to the list
5. Initialize Git
6. as usual...
```
