## Pok√©dex

In the pokemon world, there are hundreds of pokemon species. In this world, a trainer's best friend is the Pokedex - a pocket wiki about all pokemon where they can find, categorize, and search for a pokemon.

We will create a web application Pokedex, that helps trainers worldwide learn more about their favorite pokemon.

### Back-end: API Requirements

-   Download and transform data as needed from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank">kaggle</a>
    
    -   You can take the csv file from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types" target="_blank">this</a>
        
    -   And high quality images from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset" target="_blank">dataset</a>
        
    -   Transform data to the given form:
        
    -   `pokemons.json`
    
    -   Note: The given CSV file contains the data of 809 pokemon. However, the images are about 721 png images. Your job is to cut off the Pokemon for which we don't have an image source.
-   API for getting all Pok√©mons
    
    -   Search Pok√©mons by Type

    -   Search Pok√©mons by Name

-   API for getting a single Pok√©mon information together with the previous and next pokemon information.
    
    -   `/api/pokemons/2` return the pokemon with id `2`, `1` and `3`
        
    -   `/api/pokemons/1` return the pokemon with id `1`, `721` and `2`
        
    -   `/api/pokemons/721` return the pokemon with id `721`, `720` and `1`
        
    -   Example:
        
        the API `/api/pokemons/25` will return:
-   API for creating new Pok√©mon (you can use the existing data set or <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/)" target="_blank">faker</a>. Handle error for the cases below:
    
    -   ‚ÄúMissing required data.‚Äù (`name`, `id`, `types` or `URL`)
    -   ‚ÄúPok√©mon can only have one or two types.‚Äù (if the `types`'s length is greater than `2`)
    -   ‚ÄúPok√©mon's type is invalid.‚Äù (if the types of Pok√©mon are not included in the valid given `Pok√©monTypes` array)
    -   ‚ÄúThe Pok√©mon already exists.‚Äù (if `id` or `name` exists in the database)
    
    The valid type array
-   üöÄ API for updating a Pok√©mon
    
-   üöÄ API for deleting a Pok√©mon by Id
    
-   üöÄ Expand the current database with generated data for:  
    - `description`  
    - `height`  
    - `weight`  
    - `categpry`  
    - `abilities`
    
-   `pokemons.json`

### Front-end: UI Requirements

-   User sees all the Pok√©mons
-   User sees a single detail page for a Pok√©mon
-   User sees filter UI and can filter Pok√©mons with Type
-   User sees search UI and can search Pok√©mons by Name
-   üöÄ User sees Infinite scroll (you can use this <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) for the feature" target="_blank">library</a>

**For this assignment, you will be provided with a front-end codebase.**

**Clone this <a href="https://github.com/coderschool/coderdex-fe.git" target="_blank">repo</a> for the front-end part. Make sure that the API from your back-end is the perfect match for the UI without changing anything in the front-end.**
