# Automate boring tasks with NodeJs

<br />
<br />

## Overview

### The importance of content

In web development, logic is just one part of making a good web app. A social platform will have no value without users; A game store is just a blank canvas without game information and images.

### Making data

To make a prototype to demonstrate to the audience, we must add content to our web. For example, to display our pagination, we have to have 100 items with their info like title, description, etc. Meaning someone has to come up with `100\*x` items content and enter it into the database. Imagine a more extensive application where we want to make a dashboard with a sale report. Someone must make `x` user accounts, and each has to make `n` carts that include `z` products.
In short, a time-consuming task could be automated by writing a script.

### Automate the data-generating process

Automation uses technology to accomplish tasks with as little human interaction as possible. In computing, automation is usually achieved by a program, a script, or batch processing. For example, a web scrapper program to get website data, a tool to transform .mp3 to .mp4, a tool to mock up data for testing, automation test, etc.

There are many ways to make data, such as:

- Manually enter each piece of information
- Write a script to randomize info and save it to the database
- Write a script to collect data from a website
- Write a script to call to an API, then save the data in our database
- Collect datasets from others, then write a script to process any given data format into our own.

We will focus on the Randomize and Collect-Process methods.

## Random data with Faker Js

```md
[FakerJs](https://fakerjs.dev/) is a popular library that generates fake (but reasonable) data that can be used for things such as:
```

- Unit Testing
- Performance Testing
- Building Demos
- Working without a completed backend

### Set up

Install it as a Dev Dependency using your favorite package manager.

```cmd
npm install @faker-js/faker --save-dev
```

### Basic usage

```js
import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";

const randomName = faker.name.findName(); // Rowan Nikolaus
const randomEmail = faker.internet.email(); // Kassandra.Haley@erich.biz
```

## Lab: Random mock user data

Checkout the tutorial video for a complete walkthrough.
Let's write a script to generate a mock user for our database.

### We will be using :

- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server" target="_blank">json server</a> for simple api endpoints
- <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/" target="_blank">faker js</a> for randomize data

### API Endpoints :

- GET : list of all users with pagination
- GET : search users by ...

### Script feature :

- Create n users on command
- Save users info to `db.json`

```cmd
node create-users 40
```

## Collect and process datasets from others (Kaggle)

The other way to have content for our project database is by collecting datasets from different sources.
Many awesome platforms serve datasets for us to choose from. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> is one example. Go to the website and browse many different categories of data for your upcoming projects.

### Kaggle dataset collection

## CSV to JSON

Most of the time, there will be a dataset to help you create your next projects. It is easy to find datasets but harder to use. Sometimes the dataset you found could be in a format that is not familiar. For example, spreadsheet files from Google Sheets or Excel would be in `.csv` format rather than `.json`.
For this challenge, we will now learn how to translate .cvs to .json.

## Lab: CSV to JSON

[Csv to json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson) is a popular library that helps process CSV files. Its main feature is to translate `.csv` to `.json`.

### Set up

Install it as a Dev Dependency using your favorite package manager.

```cmd
npm i --save csvtojson
```

### Basic usage

```js
/** csv file
a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6
*/
const csvFilePath = "<path to csv file>";
const csv = require("csvtojson");
csv()
  .fromFile(csvFilePath)
  .then((jsonObj) => {
    console.log(jsonObj);
    /**
     * [
     * 	{a:"1", b:"2", c:"3"},
     * 	{a:"4", b:"5". c:"6"}
     * ]
     */
  });

// Async / await usage
const jsonArray = await csv().fromFile(csvFilePath);
```
