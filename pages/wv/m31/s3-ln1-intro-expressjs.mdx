# Intro to ExpressJs

<br />
<br />

## Express

It's time to build a backend. We'll do so by using a NPM package named [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### Web Applications

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### APIs

Creating a robust API is quick and easy with many HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal.

### Performance

Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features without obscuring Node.js features you know and love.

<br />

## Backend API server overview

An API server will allow us to `Create, Read, Update, Delete(C.R.U.D.)` a `resource/entity/foo` in our database through a `URL`.

```
| Route Name | URL         | HTTP Verb   | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Index      | `/foos`     | `GET`       | Get **a list** of `foos`                                              |
| Create     | `/foos`     | `POST`      | Create a **new** `foo`                                                |
| Show       | `/foos/:id` | `GET`       | Get **a detailed** `foo`                                              |
| Edit       | `/foos/:id` | `PUT/PATCH` | Update a **property/attribute/params** of a `foo`                     |
| Destroy    | `/foos/:id` | `DELETE`    | Delete/Destroy/Remove **an individual** `foo` from the list of `foos` |
```

The URLs can also "listen" for `query parameters` and produce **dynamic** `results/output/data`.

Hint: try console.log the req object and checkout `body, params, query`.

### Query String Params

We must also handle the following URLs.

```
| Route Name          | URL                          | HTTP Verb | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Index               | `/foos`                      | `GET`     | Get some `foos`. Defaulting to `pg=1` & `limit=20`                                                             |
| Search for spam     | `/foos?q=spam`               | `GET`     | Find a foo where it's title/name/description contains `spam`                                                   |
| English Foos        | `/foos?language=en`          | `GET`     | Get some `foos` where the language **property/attribute/params** of the foo is `English`                       |
| English Foos sorted | `/foos?language=en&sort=asc` | `GET`     | Get some `foos` where the language **property/attribute/params** of the foo is `English` & sorted in asc order |
```

## Middlewares I : App level middlewares

```js
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const logger = require("morgan");
const cors = require("cors");
const indexRouter = require("./routes/index");

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(logger("dev"));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

app.use("/news", indexRouter);
```

### Cors

CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect / Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options
It helps us disable CORS error.
Readmore [here](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#:~:text=CORS%20is%20a%20node.js%20package%20for%20providing%20a,with%20various%20options.%20Follow%20me%20%28%40troygoode%29%20on%20Twitter%21)

### Morgan Logger

Logger is a programming technique to keep logs of how a program runs. It contains many errors, such as process, success, and error.

Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
Create a new morgan logger middleware function using the given format and options. The format argument may be a string of a predefined name (see below for the names), a string of a format string, or a function that will produce a log entry.

The format function will be called with three arguments `tokens`, `req`, and `res`, where `tokens` is an object with all defined tokens, req is the HTTP request, and res is the HTTP response. The function is expected to return a string that will be the logline or undefined/null to skip logging.
Readmore [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

### Path

In Node.js, the path module is an inbuilt module that deals with paths and directories. Every Operating System has its own way of managing paths and related operations.

For example, different operating systems will have different syntaxes to navigate the file system. Path module helps NodeJS to adapt to the native OS syntax

- Window: ~\FolderA\FolderB\text.txt
- Linux: ~/FolderA/FolderB/text.txt

Readmore [here](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/path-module-in-node-js-46a244a9e47b)

### Cookie parser

This module help exposes the cookies sent along with client request. Which may use to help authorization, cache, ...
Parse Cookie header and populate `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns `req.secret` so it may be used by other middleware.
Readmore [here](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html)

## Express API Routes management

### Scalable

In practice, an API server may have multiple endpoints. We tend to group endpoints with the same nature together.
For example, if we have the same amount of routes for each feature, Create, Read, Update, Delete like the exercise.
Then apply that for:

- authors/ : everything related to CRUD authors' info
- movies/ : everything related to CRUD movie data
- users/ : everything related to CRUD user info

Since each endpoint listed above serves 1 type of data. It is recommended that we group them in a separate file

### File Structure and Index routes

Commonly routes folder will contain all endpoints, and the index will be connected to each one and act as a mini router in our backend.

```
|- routes/
  |- index.js
  |- users.api.js
  |- authors.api.js
  |- movies.api.js
  |- news.api.js
```

## Execution of Express Generator project

Since we are working with multiple files in our codebase, we must understand how each line and file relate. A request from a client will always go through its specific route to a result response (success or error)

### Flowchart: Execution

Here is [A flow chart on how Express file work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYozhpx0zwEcNKEyKSHvroJduUQ4-9Yb/view?usp=sharing) that may help us to visualize the process of the files

<br />

## Middlewares II : App-level middlewares (continue)

### Express `next()`

So we have explored `req` `res`. The only thing left in the Express Router callback arguments is `next()`.

In short, `next()` is a method, and when called, start **executing/calling/running** the next `middlewares` in the line.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/same", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("before request handler");
  next();
});

app.get("/same", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("handling request");
  res.sendStatus(200);
  next();
});

app.get("/same", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("after request handler");
  next();
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("Example app listening on port 3000!");
});
```

- try ` http://localhost:3000/user/123`

```console
before request handler
handling request
after request handler
```

Try commenting out the call to `next()` in the middle handler like this:

```js
app.get("/user/:id", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("handling request");
  res.sendStatus(200);
  //next();
});
```

```console
before request handler
handling request
```

Notice that the last handler (the one that prints after the request handler) does not run. That's because you no longer tell Express to run the next handler.

So it doesn't really matter if your "main" handler (the one that returns 200) was successful or not; if you want the rest of the middleware to run, you have to call `next()`.

Remember that node is async, so it can't know when the first handler's callback has finished. You have to tell it by calling next().

Again here is [A flow chart on how Express file work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYozhpx0zwEcNKEyKSHvroJduUQ4-9Yb/view?usp=sharing) that may help us to visualize the process of the files

### Error handling

The final puzzle in our Express code is Error handling middleware, which helps us handle an error in our server code.

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log("ERROR", err.message);
  return res.send(err.message);
});
```

An error handling middleware of express will have 4 arguments.
Notice that the `err` argument carries the `Error` object passed by the method before it.

We will once again use this [flow chart on how Express file work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYozhpx0zwEcNKEyKSHvroJduUQ4-9Yb/view?usp=sharing) to understand the logic of **Error handling**

### The magic control Try-catch(err)-next(err)

We are doing a task with our server; we need help to ensure it will always succeed. So in the case of failure, we must be able to identify and handle it. Recall `try-catch` in previous weeks; wrapping tasks inside of `try-catch` help us control when "thing go wrong, do this instead of crashing my precious server".

- An ABCXYZ handler

```js
try {
  //do something that may be a success or fail
} catch (err) {
  //do something when it fails
  next(err); // calling next-in-line-error-handling-middleware
}
```

Where is this middleware in `app.js`

```js
app.use("/api", ABCXYZ) // see how this middleware and it handler ABCXYZ run in prior

...
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log("ERROR", err.message);
  return res.send(err.message);
});
```

### Throw

So sometimes we want to make an error. We could use

```js
throw new Error("error message");
```

And inside a `try-catch` your new error will be caught by the error catch handler.

```js
try {
  //do something that may be a success or fail
  //but too lazy to do anything
  throw new Error("too lazy");
} catch (err) {
  //do something when it fails
  console.log(err.message); // too lazy
  next(err); // calling next-in-line-error-handling-middleware
}
```
