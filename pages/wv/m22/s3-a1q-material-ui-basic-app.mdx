## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generic Layout with MUI

Turning a (good) design into a real working webpage is a skill a web developer must have. MUI is a powerful React UI library that can help you greatly with building a basic, functioning and aesthetically pleasing website.

  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
