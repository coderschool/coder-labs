# React Timer

![:timer_clock:](https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/timer_clock.png) _Building a timer using create-react-app._

The purpose of this project is to practice our React hooks skills such as `useState` `useRef` and `Custom Hook`

Everyone knows what a timer is, even though not all timers look the same. Today, we are making a timer that looks like this, (_or better!_)

[Check out this demo to see it in action!](https://cs-react-timer.netlify.app/)

<br />

## User Stories

-   Users click the start button to start the timer
-   Users can not click the start button while the timer is running
-   Users click the stop button to see timer stop
-   Users can click start to re-start the timer after stop
-   Users can click the reset button at any time to reset the timer
-   🚀 The user sees a different timer than the one from this example. _Meaning you should change the UI display_
-   🚀 Users can “split” the timer, creating multiple records of time per “split-button clicked”

<br />

## Requirement

Fork this <a href="https://github.com/coderschool/cs-react-timer-starter-code" target="_blank">repo</a> and read through the files.  
Often time, developers are required to work with an existing codebase and improve upon it. This is one of those times.

You should only code in the designated area.  
Using the VSC search function for “Your code here”, you will see a list of all the places that require your attention.
