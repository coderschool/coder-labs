# React Ecosystem

Congratulation on getting this far into the React environment. As you are now equipped with many tools to build an interactive front-end web app, our next project challenge will be creating one of the most famous website projects, the **Movie App**.

![](https://files.tmdb.org/misc/api_step_2-1534865151.png)

We will be using the API from <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3" target="_blank">The Movie Database</a> to make the app. This is one of the most comprehensive, high-quality, yet free APIs on the internet. It provides high-quality images, many filter options, a dynamic search endpoint, and even authentication to the actual TMDB account to add a movie to your favorite list. So please read the documentation carefully, as they are very detailed.

<br />

## The Movie App

You are required to build a React front-end web to display movie info worldwide.

### User Stories

-   Users can see many movies layout on the website
-   Users can see paginate through all movies from the database
-   Users can see the detail of one single movie in a separate page, then select a movie from the list
-   Users can see information about the movie (authors, description, title, genres â€¦)
-   Users can see filter UI and can filter movies by genres
-   Users can see search UI and can search movies in the database by keyword
-   Users can see the website is responsive for the minimum of Desktop, iPhone, and Tablet
-   Users can see routes that allow user to revisit the same display when using such routes
-   ðŸš€ Users can pick a favorite movie and save it.
    -   There is an endpoint to make this happen; it is quite challenging, however. So we also allow using `localStorage` as a solution. But keep in mind that **the correct way** to make features like this is using a dedicated endpoint from the API to interact with the server and update the data
