```javascript

// input: gamesItems is a list of items.
// return: a random item in the list.
// Description: get random item from gamesItems list.
export const getRandomGameItem = (gamesItems) => {
  const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * gamesItems.length); //create index random between 0 to gamesItems.length - 1
  return gamesItems[index]; //return item
};

```



```javascript

// Description: calculator result player.
export const calculatorUserWinner = (user1GameItem, user2GameItem) => {
  if (user1GameItem.id === user2GameItem.id) {
    return "Peace"; //return both player same.
  } else if (user1GameItem.winItemIds.includes(user2GameItem.id)) {
    return "Win"; //if player 1 winItemIds list contain game player 2 id => player 1 win player 2.
  } else {
    return "Lost"; //if winItemIds list not contain game player 2 id => player 1 lost, player 2 .
  }
};
