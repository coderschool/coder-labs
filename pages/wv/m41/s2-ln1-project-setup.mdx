# Project Setup

After Project Planning, it's time to kick off the first step of any project - setting up - and most of the time, we will start by drafting the `README.md`.

It contains the What, Why, and How of your application - What problem does the app solve? Why did you build it? How to install and use the app?. Don't worry too much about making it perfect the first time around. Remember, this is your first draft of the map, which you will enhance over time.

üö© This is intended for new Developers - let's call this the **Fresh Dev <a href="http://readme.md/" target="_blank">README.md</a>**

Let's write a `README` that helps anyone familiar with code reading or not still able to grasp the ins and outs of your application.

> **Get started!**
> 
> There are so many ways we can do this, but the standard we suggest would be these 5 headings: **Project Title, Project Description, User Story, API endpoints, and Diagram Relation.**

<br/>

## The Project Title

It describes the whole project in one sentence and helps people understand the main goal and aim of the project.

Remember: short and concise.

Example:  
üëç Todo List MERN stack  
üëé My new Todo List with express mongo react and nodejs

<br/>

## The Project Description

-   What problem does your application solve?
-   What does your application do? What features contribute to solving given issues?
-   Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future?

‚öôÔ∏è To continue, let's jump into a learner's work and explore his `README` for a MeSpace site.

<br/>

## User Story

<br/>

### Background

MeSpace is a social network that allows people to join by creating accounts. Each User should provide a name, an email, and a password to create an account.

The email address should not link to any account in the system. After joining MySpace, users can update their profile with Avatar, Company, Job Title, Social Links, and a short description.

Users can write Posts that contain text content and an image. The new posts will be shown on the user profile page, allowing other users to comment. Users can also React with like or dislike on a post or a Comment.

Users can send Friend Requests to other users who have an open relationship with them. Users can accept or decline a friend request. After accepting a friend request, both become friends, and they can see posts from each other.

### Authentication

-   As a user, I can sign in with my email and password.
-   As a user, I can register for a new account with email and password.
-   As a user, I can stay signed in after refreshing the page.

### Users

-   As a user, I can see my current profile info.
-   As a user, I can see a specific user's profile given a user ID.
-   As a user, I can update my profile with Avatar, Company, Job Title, Social Links, and a short description.

### Posts

### Reactions
