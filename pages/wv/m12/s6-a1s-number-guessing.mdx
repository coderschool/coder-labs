### Solution - Number Guessing Game

```html
<h1>CoderSchool's Psychic Powers Tester</h1>
<p>
  Do you have psychic powers? If so, prove it by guessing what number I am
  thinking of right now. I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
</p>

<button onclick="makeGuess()">Guess</button>

<h2>You guessed: <span id="last-guess">?</span></h2>

<h2>That guess was <span id="correct">?</span></h2>

<h2>You have <span id="guesses-remaining">?</span> guesses remaining.</h2>
```

### JS solution

```js
let secretNumber;
let lastGuess;
let guessesRemaining = 10;
//Milestone 5.1
let pastGuesses = [];
let n; //pastGuesses.Length

const CORRECT_MESSAGE = "Correct! You must be a powerful psychic.";
const INCORRECT_MESSAGE = "Incorrect. You are merely a normal human.";

function generateNumber() {
  //   return 5;
  // MILESTONE 2: Right now the secret number is always 5. Change this
  // to return a secret number between 1 and 10.
  return (secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (10 - 1) + 1));
  // Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);
}

function checkIsCorrect() {
  //   return true;
  // MILESTONE 4: Right now every guess will be true. Change
  // the above code so it checks to make sure lastGuess
  // is equal to secretNumber.

  if (lastGuess == secretNumber) {
    return 0;
  } else if (lastGuess > secretNumber) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
}

function makeGuess() {
  if (!secretNumber) {
    generateNumber();
  }
  // MILESTONE 3: ADD CODE HERE to pop up a dialog
  // asking the user for a number.

  lastGuess = parseInt(prompt("What is Guess"), 10);
  pastGuesses.push(lastGuess);
  guessesRemaining--;
  //--------------------------------------------
  updatePage();

  // const INCORRECT_MESSAGE_HIGH = `Sorry! Your guess of ${pastGuesses.length} was too high! You have guessed ${guessesRemaining} times.
  // Your previous guesses were: ${pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 1]}.`;
  // const INCORRECT_MESSAGE_LOW = `Sorry! Your guess of ${pastGuesses.length} was too low! You have guessed ${guessesRemaining} times.
  // Your previous guesses were: ${pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 1]}.`;
}

// Don't worry about this part! Feel free to play around,
// but we'll teach you all about how JavaScript and HTML
// work together in the next section. If you're done Milestone
// 5, you'll need to fiddle around in here a bit.

function updatePage() {
  document.getElementById("last-guess").innerHTML = lastGuess;
  const correct = document.getElementById("correct");
  const isCorrect = checkIsCorrect();
  if (isCorrect == 0) {
    correct.style.color = "green";
    correct.innerHTML = CORRECT_MESSAGE;
  } else if (isCorrect == -1) {
    correct.style.color = "red";
    correct.innerHTML = `Sorry! Your guess of ${
      pastGuesses.length
    } was too low! You have guessed ${pastGuesses.length} times.
    Your previous guesses were: ${pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 2]}, ${
      pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 3]
    }.`;
  } else if (isCorrect == 1) {
    correct.style.color = "red";
    correct.innerHTML = `Sorry! Your guess of ${
      pastGuesses.length
    } was too high! You have guessed ${pastGuesses.length} times.
    Your previous guesses were: ${pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 2]}, ${
      pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 3]
    }.`;
  }

  const remaining = document.getElementById("guesses-remaining");
  remaining.innerHTML = guessesRemaining;

  //Milestone 5.1
  console.log(pastGuesses);
  console.log(pastGuesses.length);
  //   console.log(`Sorry! Your guess of ${pastGuesses.length} was too high! You have guessed ${guessesRemaining} times. Your previous guesses were: ${pastGuesses[pastGuesses.length - 1]}.`)
}

console.log(generateNumber());
console.log(lastGuess);
