# Assignment 3

# Question 1:

```js
Body Type from BMI Write a function to check your body type base on weight and
height. Known that: BMI = weight in kg/ (height in m)2

Check the BMI, if BMI is:
less than 18: underweight
18 to less than
25: normal weight 25 to less than
30: overweight
30 and above: obesity Return the right body type.

Examples:

bodyType(1.64,60) should return "normal weight"
bodyType(1.6,70) should return "overweight"

function bodyType (height, weight) {
  //YOUR CODE HERE
  const bmi = weight / (height \* height)
}
```

## Answer:

```js

function bodyType (height, weight) {
//YOUR CODE HERE
const bmi = weight / (height \* height)
  if(bmi <18) return "underweight";
  else if(bmi <25) return "normal weight";
  else if(bmi <30) return "overweight";
  else return "obesity";

}

```

# Question 2:

```js
Count Your Calories You are on a diet and record your total calorie intake every
day. After a week, the 7 numbers are recorded in an array. Calculate your total
weight gain or loss for the week if you burn 2000 calories a day, and 1 kg is
equivalent to 7700 calories.

NOTE: 1 kg = 7700 calories totalKcal([1600, 1600, 1500, 1700, 1800, 2000, 2000]) // should return - 0.233766234, meaning you will lose 0.233766234 kg

totalKcal([2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000]) //should return 0

function totalKcal(arr) { let result = 0; // YOUR CODE HERE
return result; }

```

## Answer:

```js
function totalKcal(arr) {
  let result = 0;
  // YOUR CODE HERE
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result += (arr[i] - 2000) / 7700;
  }

  return result;
}
```

# Question 3:

```js
Yard Sale You are moving to a new place and having a yard sale. You make a list
of all the items and their corresponding prices. Calculate the total money in
VND you can earn if you sell all the items.

For example: const items = [{ name:"table", price: 100000, currency: "VND" }, { name: "microwave", price: 700000,
currency: "VND" }, { name: "sofa", price: 500000, currency: "VND" } ]
totalPrice(items) //should return 1300000

function totalPrice(arr) {
  let total = 0
  //YOUR CODE HERE return total
}
```

## Answer:

```js
function totalPrice(arr) {
  let total = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```
