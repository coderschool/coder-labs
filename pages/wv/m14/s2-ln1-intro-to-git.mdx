# Intro to Git & Github

GitHub, in a nutshell, is the way to share files with other people collaboratively without overwriting other people’s stuff. GitHub is sort of a community, and there are many open-source projects, meaning the project’s code is available to look at. GitHub is a web-based platform based on a technology called Git, G-I-T.

Git is a piece of software called version control. It is a fancy way of saying it Keeps track of code changes. Git has a lot of other features that are useful for software developers. So if you’re programming, eventually, you have to learn Git at some point.

## Git commands

<br />

### Working on a local repository

<CH.Spotlight>

```bash
git init
```

---

**1. Turning the current folder into a git repository**

> Why do we need to turn a folder into a git repository?

> -Turning a regular folder into a git repo will help us keep track of changes between files within the folder. We can see a history of differences amongst many developers working on the same repo.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/undHVSv.png" />

```bash
git init
```

---

**2. A helpful command to see what’s currently going on in the git repo**

> What `git status` show us?
>
> - What branch are we in: `On branch master`
> - What commits we have made: `No commits yet`
> - What files have been created but haven't been added or committed: `Untracked files`

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/WZVHWgG.png" />

```bash
git status
```

---

**3. Adds a file to the “staging area”.**

> This means telling git to include the file in the next time it saves a repo version. `git add .` to add all changed files.
>
> - After adding the `example.txt` file, let's `git status` to check what changes have been made.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/fOAVJLr.png" />

> - Or you can `git add .` to add all the files that have been created.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/Fgfw8wp.png" />

```bash
git add <file_name>
git add .
```

---

**4. Saves the version of the repository with a message.**

> After the file is added, let's `commit` that changes to the repo. Why do you need to [commit](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_commit.asp#:~:text=Adding%20commits%20keep%20track%20of,should%20always%20include%20a%20message.)?
>
> - Most of the time, when you make changes in a file, it's a good practice to left a message on what has been done. Especially when you are working with a team of developers.
> - After commit, let's check again with `git status`.
> - `nothing to commit` shows how all your changes have been committed and are ready for other teammates to read.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/VWjUo68.png" />

```bash
git commit -m "Your message here"
```

---

**5. To see all the actions you have done**

> To see all the versions you have saved, you can see that the commit message is a very good indicator or reminder of what was changed in a particular version. So make sure you use good commit messages.

> - After `git log`, you will be taken to a different view.
> - To exit this viewport : `:q`

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/eucTHsR.png" />

```bash
git log
```

---

**6. Reverts code back to the previous commit**

> To revert to the previous commit, you first have to get the commit code.
>
> - Call `git log` to get the right code.
> - Exit the view : `:q`

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/IrcLSGB.png" />

> - Then replace that code with `<commit>`.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/rJntyUg.png" />

```bash
git reset --hard <commit>
```

## Working with branches

A branch is a version of the repository. Each branch has its own commit history and current version.

<CH.Spotlight>

```bash
git branch
```

---

**1. Shows all branches of your repository**

> - You will be directed to a different view, here are your existing branches.
> - To exit view: `:q`

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/QyXoVto.png" />

```bash
git branch
```

---

**2. Creates a new branch**

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/qNj4r3Z.png" />

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

---

**3. Switches to a branch**

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/j8Zq4uf.png" />

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

---

**4. Merges the branch `<branch_name>` with current branch**

> - Now let's merge `master` and `branch-01`

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/kinnBGE.png" />

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

<br />
## Working with online remote repositories

<CH.Spotlight>

```bash
git clone <url>
```

---

**1. Makes a copy of a repository and stores it on your computer.**

> - You can copy a repo's `https` link and paste it after `git clone`.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/OmfvdaA.png" />

```bash
git clone <url>
```

---

**2. Pushes the changes I made on my computer up to the GitHub repo**

> - After making changes to the file, let's push to the remote repo so everybody can clone, read and fix your code.
> - `origin`: the remote you want to push to.
> - `main`: name of the branch you want to push to.
> - If the branch is up-to-date and there is nothing else to push.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/UbKw7y2.png" />

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

**3. Is the opposite of git push, pull the most recent version of the online repository.**

> - There will be more than one developer working on the repo, remember to `pull` every now and then so that you can see the updates from other teammates.

> > <img style={{ width: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/34fd5PB.png" />

```bash
git pull

```
