# GitHub and Netlify

<br />
<br />

## Overview

Recently in the course, we have built all the websites using codepen.io or codesanbox.io. But things are moving to local (your laptop); everything now is built and tested locally. What if we want to share our work with friends or dear mentors? Netlify and GitHub are here to help.

In short, a web project comprises 2 parts: the codebase and the production of that code. With codepen.io or codesanbox.io, all of them are in one place, which makes it easier for beginners to start fast. But we are no beginners; we want to utilize our machine power and be independent of internet hiccups to code locally, then deploy (publish) our work later when necessary.

### Online codebase on GitHub

The local codebase lives in your machine; only you have access. To push your code to GitHub, create an online version of your code available in case of a water spill on your laptop. An online repository on Github will help you to:

- Add collaborators and get help around the world
- Safe from accidents happening to your machine
- Allow other services (Netlify) to access your code 24/7. (Fact : CodeSanbox website will sleep after 30 minutes. Surely Facebook should not host on Codesandbox)
- Join a network of other amazing devs like you

### Quickstart GitHub

1. Sign-up for a GitHub account [Github website](https://github.com/)
2. Create a repository [Get started creating your first GitHub repository here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) _Tip: You can learn more about GitHub in that guide_

## About Netlify

<br />

### Online production on Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a web hosting infrastructure and automation technology company. Netlify simplifies the process of deploying your website. It does all the work for us that we probably don't want to spend too much time or effort on. Netlify works by connecting to your GitHub repository to pull your source code, then it typically runs a build process to pre-render all of your pages in static HTML. Hosting a website on Netlify means :

- Globally hosting your project online (No more sending `http://localhost` to your friends )
- Update GitHub codebase can trigger an update of the actual website
- Configure to hide sensitive info (API keys, Services password, Cheat code for game)
- Change the domain name.
- Free!

### Quickstart Netlify

1. Sign-up for a Netlify account: First, get to the site [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up with your GitHub account. This will help Netlify connect automatically to your Github account for the fastest deploying experiences.
2. Follow the exercise below to deploy your first project to Netlify
