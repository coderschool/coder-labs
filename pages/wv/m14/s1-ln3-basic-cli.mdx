This is what a terminal console look like and as a programmer you will learn how to use this to increase your coding productivity as well increase your cool-i-ness under the untrained eyes.

## Overview

The command line interface (CLI) also called the terminal, or the shell. It's a command language that allows us to work with files on our computers in a way that's far more efficient and powerful than using a GUI (graphical user interface aka point'n'click).

**Remember, we type faster than we click !**

Proficiency in CLI will help you:

- Coding effiency
- Smooth transition to Cloud based services
- Easier to debug
- Looks **dangerous**
- Become a skilled developer
