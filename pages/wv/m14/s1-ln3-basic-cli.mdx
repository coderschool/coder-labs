# Command Line Interface

You probably have seen this in many hacking scenes.

This is what a terminal console looks like, and as a programmer, you will learn how to use this to increase your coding productivity as well increase your cool-i-ness under untrained eyes.

## Overview

The command line interface (CLI) is also called the terminal, or the shell. It's a command language that allows us to work with files on our computers in a far more efficient and powerful way than using a GUI (graphical user interface aka point'n'click).
**Remember, we type faster than we click !**

Proficiency in CLI will help you:

- Coding efficiency
- Smooth transition to cloud-based services
- Easier to debug
- Looks **dangerous**
- Become a skilled developer
