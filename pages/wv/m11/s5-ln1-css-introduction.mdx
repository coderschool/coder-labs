# CSS: Introduction

<br />
<br />
<br />

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is CSS?

Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website.

<br />
### Anatomy of a CSS ruleset

This whole structure is called a ruleset. A ruleset consists of:

<img
  style={{ width: "500px" }}
  src="https://i.imgur.com/RdLtqUP.png
"
/>

- **Declaration**: is a single rule which specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
- **Selector**: defines the element(s) to be styled.
- **Properties**: are the way you can style an HTML element.
- **Property value**: is one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values, like red, blue, etc.)

<br />
### The important part of the syntax:

- Each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces `{}`.
- Use a colon `:` to separate the property from its values.
- Use a semicolon `;` to separate each declaration from the next one.

<br />
<br />

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to attaching the styles to the document?

There are three ways that style rules can be applied to an HTML document:

#### Inline styles

Applying properties and values to a single element by using style attribute in the element itself.

üö© Inline styles should be avoided. They are problematic in that they merge presentation information into the structural markup and make it more difficult to make changes.

```html index.html focus=8:10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:red">Heading 1 with Inline styles</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

#### Embedded style sheets

Embedded style sheets are placed in a HTML document via the `style` tag.

üö© The style could be in the `body` or `head` tag. But we recommend to place it in the head of the document.

```html index.html focus=3,7:15
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1 with Inline styles</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

```html index.html focus=3,7:11
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1 with Inline styles</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### External style sheets

```css styles.css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

The external `.css` file that contains a number of style rules.

The `.css` document is then linked to the HTML documents.

üö© This is the most powerful and recommended method for attaching style sheets to content.
