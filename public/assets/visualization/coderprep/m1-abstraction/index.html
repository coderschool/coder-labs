        <p>
          <strong>Abstraction </strong>is one of the fundamental core components
          of Computer Science, together with Decomposition, Pattern Recognition,
          and Algorithms. The essence of Abstraction involves hiding all the
          features that we donâ€™t need in order to focus on those that are more
          important. From this, we create a representation of what we are trying
          to solve and develop algorithms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Abstraction can be applied to any aspect of our life. For example, an
          e-commerce store records information about its inventories and
          customers, then organizes it in tables. From these tables, they
          develop a system called ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) (fig1). By
          looking at this diagram, we can understand how the business is
          operating without diving deep into detail. This is an example of
          abstraction.

          fig1 âŽ¯ Entity Relationship Diagram. By looking at this, we can
          understand, for example, which customer makes which order of which
          product and their review.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Abstraction is also useful in data visualization. A social network can
          be visualized with dots and lines. Each dot represents one person. The
          line that connects two dots represents the relationship between these
          two people. In real life, a person can be described using many
          different characteristics (age, hair color, nationality, sense of
          humor, etc). However, to achieve this visualization, we use
          abstraction and hide all the irrelevant information. The audience of
          this visualization does not need to know the hair color of a person in
          the graph for example.

          On the right side is a visualization of a company. Each dot represents
          an employee and each line represents the connection between two
          employees. As the company grows, employees grow more and more distant
          from each other in terms of connection. The visualization is the
          abstraction of this observation.
